###Disclaimer
One of my first App for my Garmin Vivoactive.
There have been many issues between the Emulator and the real result on my watch.
Some thing didnÂ´t work as expected, so I stoped developing at some point.

Everything works except storing the Activity during a correct quit-process.
This is only an optional feature to count your Steps during the match...
Probably I will always abort the Activity at the end, because until now, there is no nice way to display your results in Connect (the Type Squash is unknown, off course).

Feel free to use my (dirty) code :)

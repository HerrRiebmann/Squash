### Disclaimer
One of my first App for my Garmin Vivoactive.
There have been many issues between the Emulator and the real result on my watch.
Some thing didnÂ´t work as expected, so I stoped developing at some point.

But now, I was asked to share it, and I challanged myself to make it work :)

Feel free to use my (dirty) code :)

### Compatibility
Sucessfully updated to SDK 1.2.9 seems to work now!
